NativShark started as NihongoShark and had a course on the Teachable platform. I saw an opportunity to improve the brand and the experience and rushed into it head first.

While the content that was originally hosted on Teachable was amazing, the experience it provided was not much better than the experiences that already existed. The existing experiences either required that you did a lot of manual work to figure out what you should be learning next or where to go next, or they did that work for you but did not teach you useful or correct Japanese. I wanted to change that.

## Requirement Gathering

I originally reached out to the team on Discord and offered my services. After discussing what I had in mind for the system and the potential I saw in what they had, they offered me a job as the CTO of the company to work alongside the CEO to build the system.

NativShark was unique in that the data models required by the system did not lend themselves freely to using an existing no-code CMS, meaning that I had to not only create a platform for students to learn Japanese, but also a CMS that allowed the content team to create the content that the students would be working through.

The CEO and myself worked together to create a list of requirements for the system alongside a mockup in Figma for both the student-facing site as well as the admin site. I had some unique problems to solve to make the system work, but I was excited to come up with a solution that hid the complexity from the user.
